## What is ShadowNet?

ShadowNet is a lightweight CLI port scanner built from scratch in Python.  
It scans a target IP across ports 1–1000 and reports every open port — fast, clean, no noise.

Built as a first offensive security tool by a self-taught red teamer.

---

## Features

- 🔍 Scans ports 1 to 1000
- ⚡ Fast timeout per port (0.5s)
- 🎯 Clean output — open ports only
- 💻 Pure Python — no dependencies
- 🖥️ Works on any Linux machine

---

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rtx772-eng/shadownet
cd shadownet
python3 shadownet.py
```

```
Enter target IP: 45.33.32.156

[+] Port 22 OPEN
[+] Port 80 OPEN
```

---

## How It Works

```
1. Ask user for target IP
2. Loop through ports 1 to 1000
3. Try to connect to each port (socket)
4. Print open ports only
```

Under the hood — Python's `socket` library knocks on each port.  
If the connection returns `0` → port is open.  
Anything else → closed, move on.

---

## Code

```python
import socket

ip = input("Enter target IP: ")

for port in range(1, 1001):
    sock = socket.socket()
    sock.settimeout(0.5)
    result = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))
    if result == 0:
        print(f"[+] Port {port} OPEN")
    sock.close()
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] v1.1 — Add banner grabbing (detect service on port)
- [ ] v1.2 — Custom port range input
- [ ] v1.3 — Save results to file
- [ ] v2.0 — Multi-threaded (10x faster)
- [ ] v3.0 — Full recon suite
